I'm @Lucas75

* I took software developement as a hobby when had 10 years old and still 
  love it. When I am not working I am studying computer science, data 
  science and making experiments.
  
* I have a degree in IT management, a specialization in Artificial
  Intelligence and several extra credits and master level disciplines
  in hard math, logic, statistics, computer science, information 
  sciences and business management. 

* I work as senior analyst on a control department of a large brazillian 
  public financial institution since 2005 where I created semi-automated 
  supervision software that grow over the years to create a company branch
  with more than 400 employees.  
 
* I embraced agile methodologies, devops and bigdata even before they 
  was called that. I have difficult to understand developers that aren't
  also busness specialists and responsible by the business goals of the
  company/department they work for.
  
* As developers we study the rules of information and processing like
  data relations, dependency, queues, division of work, parallel processing 
  and this makes us capable of percieving things about the company business 
  that very few people can.

* And the characteristics of the products are dictated by the side effects
  of the technologies used and the design of a software will dictate where
  people must be allocated on the company.
  
* I begin my professional carrer as a C/C++ developer, but quickly moved
  to java/php on the server side. There is a lot of better languages than
  java, but unfortunatedlly go garbage colletor is too weak and rust 
  does not have exception handling. I am hopeful on Kotlin.
  
* I have a lot of experience working with PostgreSQL which is a fantastic
  database for data analysis because it supports advanced indexing, json
  and handle very well databases with several terabytes, several billion
  records and a lot of people working at the same time. 

* In the last 20 years I worked with a combo of Java, PHP and PostgreSQL
  which is a greate combination.

* From 2024, I accepted a new challenge in my carrer and we are creating
  new business soluctions using DotNet/C#. It was not my choice, but I
  discovered that DotNet improved a lot since become open source and is
  now competitive with GoLang.   
  
* I also use Python because it is great for some data analysis tasks
  and statistics. But I avoid using Python in production because it is 
  too slow and its a dependency nightmare: Code developed today is not
  expected to work 6 months from now.
  
* I have several software that work in production without change for
  more than 20 years and I think this should be the norm. Software should
  only change if the business or the need for it changed. Not because
  there is a new version of some lib.
